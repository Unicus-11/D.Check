      <p>How does D.Check work?</p>
      <h3>Do a dibetes risk check in 3 steps. Its that simple!</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Speak a short fixed phrase (e.g., “Health is my greatest wealth”) for 6&dash;10 seconds.
         Our system analyzes vocal tone and micro-variations to extract health-related acoustic features <img width="200" src="images/record.png" alt=" Step 1 recording logo"></li>
            
         <li>Place your fingertip gently on your phone&comma;s camera with the flash on for 30 seconds.
         We extract heart-rate and pulse-wave features from color intensity changes.<img width="200" src="images/scaner.png" alt="Step 2 finger scanner logo"></li>

         <li>Answer a few questions on age, height, weight, and lifestyle.
         Your responses provide context that improves prediction accuracy.<img width="200" src="images/survey.png" alt=" Step 3survey logo"></li>
      
         <li>Receive an AI-based health-risk score (screening only, not diagnostic) and suggested next actions.
         All data are encrypted and processed securely<img width="200" src="images/result.png" alt="Step 4 Result logo"></li>
      </ul>

   <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
   <img src="images/FAQ.svg" alt="FAQ logo" width="200">

   <details>
      <summary> Q What is this voice and camera&dash;based screening tool?</summary> 
      <p>This tool helps users record short voice clips and fingertip videos to extract health-related features (like vocal and pulse characteristics).<br> These features, combined with simple lifestyle and health questions, are used to estimate potential diabetes risk — purely for research and awareness, not diagnosis.</p>
   </details>

   <details>
      <summary>Is this an online medical consultation or a diagnostic test?</summary>
      <p>No. This is <bold>not a medical consultation or diagnostic service</bold>. It&comma;s an educational and research-based screening tool designed to raise awareness about possible risk indicators.</p>
   </details>

   <details>

      <summary>How do I use the app?</summary>

      <p>You&comma;ll record:
         <ol>
            <li>A short voice sample (saying a fixed sentence for ~8 seconds)</li>

            <li>A fingertip video (30 seconds using your phone&comma;s rear camera + flash)</li>

            <li>A brief survey (age, weight, lifestyle, etc.)
            After recording, the app extracts key features automatically and provides a risk score or report.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
   </details>

   <details>
      <summary>Is my data safe and secure?</summary>
      <p>Yes. All data (audio, video, survey answers) is encrypted and stored securely. Only anonymized numerical features are used for modeling. You can request deletion of your data anytime.</p>
   </section>

   <details>
      <summary>Why do I need to say a fixed phrase?</summary>
      <p>Using the same phrase for all users ensures that extracted voice features (pitch, jitter, shimmer, etc.) are comparable — improving model consistency and reliability.</p>
   </details>

   <details>
      <summary>Can I use this app without sharing my personal details?</summary>
      <p>Yes&comma; you can use it anonymously. We only require minimal info (e.g., age, sex) to improve accuracy. All identifying details are optional and securely handled.</p>
   </details>

   <details>
      <summary>Is this tool approved by doctors?</summary>
      <p>This project is based on peer-reviewed research (e.g., PLOS, PMC studies) and follows scientific methods for feature extraction — but it’s not a replacement for medical consultation. Always confirm results with a qualified clinician.</p>
   </details>

   <details>
      <summary>Can I see how my data is used?</summary>
      <p>Yes. The app displays extracted numerical features (like average pitch, HR, HRV) and shows how they contribute to the estimated risk score. You can also download your anonymized data if you wish.</p>

   </details>

   <details>
      <summary>What if I get a “High Risk” result?</summary>
      <p>Treat it as a screening flag, not a diagnosis. You should consult a healthcare provider and consider a blood glucose or HbA1c test for confirmation.</p>
